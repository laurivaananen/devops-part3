# Docker

Docker allows you to package not only your application but all of its dependencies, libraries and configurations.

## Why use Docker?

Docker solves many of the problems programmers are facing.

* Application works differently on different computers
* Development and production environments are different which might cause problems
* Running multiple applications at the same time 
* Moving an application, its data and the environment in which it's running to a different machine is difficult to do without manual configuring
